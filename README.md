## Description
This repository contains a Django-based backend system for a banking application. The project demonstrates the use of Django's powerful features to implement user authentication, profile management, and core banking model functionalities.

## Key Features
- User authentication system including registration, login, and logout.
- Profile view and edit capabilities.
- Implementation of a `Bank` model to represent bank details.

## Project Structure
- `forms.py`: Defines Django forms for user registration and authentication.
- `urls.py`: URL configurations for the banking application.
- `views.py`: Views for handling user registration, login, profile view, and edit.
- `apps.py`: Django app configuration for the banking system.
- `models.py`: Django models, including the `Bank` model with fields like bank ID, name, description, and owner.

## How to Run
